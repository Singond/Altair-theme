Altair Theme for Cinnamon
=========================

A personal dark theme for the Cinnamon Desktop.

Installation
============

From the project root, run `make install`. This will copy the source files
in `<project_root>/src` into `~/.themes/Altair/`. You can also copy the files
manually. In any case, restart Cinnamon to see the changes.

Compatibility
=============

Tested on Cinnamon `4.0.9`.

The theme is designed to work with a custom version of the
[Icing Task Manager](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/269)
applet instead of the default window list. The custom version can be found
[here](https://github.com/Singond/icingtaskmanager).
